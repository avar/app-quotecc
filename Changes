Revision history for App::QuoteCC

{{$NEXT}}

    - Don't mark any strings coming into the program as UTF-8. Just
      apply binmode() to the filehandles. Garbage in/garbage out.

    - Test UTF-8 output of C programs, and test Lua if we have it

    - FIX UTF-8 output & tests.

    - Add App::QuoteCC::Input::Text for line-delimited text input.

    - Stop using perl5i to avoid perl5i issue #99
      (http://github.com/schwern/perl5i/issues#issue/99)

      Maybe I'll give perl5i another shot once it's more stable. But
      for now I don't feel like chasing its bugs.

    - Cleanup the tempdir() after we're done with it.

    - Be more pedantic about checking for curl/gcc due to cpantesters failures

0.04 2010-05-31 09:32:23

    - Add support for Lua output. The Lua output requires the Lua
      POSIX library.

    - Typo: ::Perl not ::C in App::QuoteCC::Output::Perl

    - Hack to make UTF-8 input work. Use Encode to mark strings as
      UTF-8 (why weren't they marked before?!), and use open, not
      File::Slurp to spit out files.

    - Lots of changes, more docs, bugfixes, Perl backend and more

0.01 2010-05-17 23:32:52

    - Initial buggy version
