{{$NEXT}}

    - Cleanup the tempdir() after we're done with it.

    - Be more pedantic about checking for curl/gcc due to cpantesters failures

    - Add support for Lua output. The Lua output requires the Lua
      POSIX library.

    - Typo: ::Perl not ::C in App::QuoteCC::Output::Perl

    - Hack to make UTF-8 input work. Use Encode to mark strings as
      UTF-8 (why weren't they marked before?!), and use open, not
      File::Slurp to spit out files.
